## Resources
- Review Make School's [hash table slides]
- Watch Make School's [hash table video lecture]
- Read Vaidehi Joshi's [articles on hash tables][BaseCS hash tables] and [hash functions][BaseCS hash functions] with beautiful drawings and excellent examples
- Watch HackerRank's [hash table video]
- Watch Harvard's [old hash table video] and [new hash table video]
- Play with VisuAlgo's [interactive hash table visualization][visualgo hash table]

## Challenges
- Add new features to improve `HashTable` class using [hash table starter code]:
    - Add `size` property that tracks the number of hash table entries in constant time
    - Implement `load_factor` - return the [load factor], the ratio of number of entries to buckets
    - Implement `_resize` - perform [dynamic resizing] when `load_factor` exceeds `0.75` after an insertion (`set` is called with a new `key`) and rehash all key-value entries
    - Run `python hashtable.py` to test `HashTable` class instance methods on a small example
    - Run `pytest hashtable_test.py` to run the [hash table unit tests] and fix any failures
- Annotate methods with complexity analysis of running time and space (memory)

## Stretch Challenges
- Implement an alternative hash table [collision resolution] strategy instead of [separate chaining] (popular variants include [linear probing], [quadratic probing], and [double hashing])
- Write additional test cases to expand the [hash table unit tests] to ensure your collision resolution strategy is robust

## Turn In Challenges So Far (10 min)

- Turn in CS 1.3 coding challenges for review, feedback, and grading!
- Deadline is end of day tomorrow (Thursday)
- Grading will start on Friday


## Abstract Types vs Concrete Data Structures (10 min)

![abstract-vs-concrete](./assets/abstract_concrete_comparision.png)

Make sure worksheet is filled out, with bad implementations crossed out

### Abstract Data Types

- Similar to an API: they specify what operations you _can_ do. They're the "rules of the game"
- They do _not_ say how to implement it implemented
- A **List** is an ordered sequence of items
- **Stacks and queues** are special kinds of lists with special rules

### Concrete Data Structure

- These are _how you implement_ abstract data types
- Similar to your backend: like deciding whether to build your server in node, python, go, etc.
- Things you can draw, and describe how they're allocated in memory
    - array (contiguous memory with indexes)
        - static (fixed size)
        - dynamic (resizable)
    - linked list
        - singly
        - doubly

### Maps and Hashtables

#### Maps
- **Map** is another abstract data type
    - Same as a **dictionary** (swift, python), or an **associative array** (php, CS literature)
    - Does _not_ have an order to it. **It is an _unordered_ collection of _key/value pairs_**
    - A phonebook is an example of this: a person's name is the key, the value is the phone number
    - Generally, curly braces are used to denote these
    - Remember, this says _nothing_ about how it is organized, it just describes what the data in it looks like (key/value pairs)

#### Hashtable

![hashtable-implementation](./assets/hashtable_implementation.png)

- A **Hashtable** is a concrete data structure used to implement a map/dictionary. Python uses this to implement its dictionaries.
- Small Side Note: you could implement a map with an array or linked list, but it wouldn't be as efficient
- A Hashtable is made up of the following parts:
    -  **hash function** - takes a key (`k`) and gives you a number (`n`)
        -  `h(k)` --> `n`
    -  **array** - a piece of contiguous memory that has indexes, which allow us to retrieve buckets in in constant time
    -  **linked list** -  each bucket in the array is a linked list of many elements. These could be empty
        -  Note: not all hashtables will use linked lists. Our implementation does use it though

#### Load Factor

-  The **load factor** (`L`) of a hashtable is the average length of each bucket = `(# entries in the hashtable)/(# of buckets)` = `n/b`
    - As the load factor gets higher, the buckets get longer. This is bad because it _increases the time it takes to iterate over buckets_, which negatively affects performance
- While the number of entries in the hashtable is not in our control (that's decided by the user; how many people they want in their phone book), the _number of buckets is in our control_.
- If we increase the number of buckets, we can get to a lower `L`, therefore dropping number of operations and _increasing performance_

#### Drawing Example

Draw a hashtable with 3 buckets and put 5 items in it

- The more buckets we have, the more space we have to store things
- Where does a new element land? Through **rehashing**: rearranging where items go to make sure they're in the appropriate spot in the **resized** hashtable
    - Remember the resturant tables example. The hashtable will need to be resized occasionally as you add more items
    - Rehash will give you a new index for items
    - More buckets means more memory!

## Activity - Drawing a Hashtable  (35 min)

### Part 1 (20 minutes)
Grab individual whiteboards and markers

Draw a hash table with the entries below, showing how it's organized in memory.

- There must be `b=5` buckets and each bucket is a linked list
- Use ../Slides/diagrams from the previous class to help you

| **Key** | **Hash**  | **Value**   |
| ----------- | --------- | ------- |
| red         | 760       | 1       |
| green       | 394       | 4       |
| orange      | 893       | 2       |
| violet      | 491       | 7       |
| yellow      | 622       | 3       |
| blue        | 468       | 5       |
| indigo      | 186       | 6       |

Finish on your own, then share and discuss with your neighbors. Talk to as many people as you can!

**TIP:** The reason there are 5 buckets is that it allows you to take a shortcut when you try to calculate the index of where that key/value pair should land: you only need to look at the last digit, as that's the only one that matters when you `mod` by 5

- example: `8 mod 5 = 3`
- Remember that `mod` means you divide and keep the remainder (i.e. `8/5` has a remainder of 3)

### Part 2 (15 min)

Now calculate the **load factor** of this hash table.

- Is it beyond the threshold (`0.75`) that triggers a resize?
- If so, perform a resize by doubling the number of buckets and reshashing all key-value entries
- Draw a new diagram showing how the key-value entries are now organized in buckets

Once you're finished, discuss with your neighbors. Make sure to discuss if the load factor is bigger, how will it affect performance?

## Code Review (45 min)

### Review with Peers (15 min)

1. Go to the Hashtable class and review the `load factor` method
1. Review the `resize` method, then see where it's called
    - **Note:** We use `_` to denote private methods in Python

### Student Presentation (30 min)

Student presents their answer to the challenges

**Tips/Highlights from the presentation**

- Look at other areas of the starter code to give you hints (i.e. how something may be called or initialized)
- `init` is called when you create a new object, but isn't _only_ called then. Be sure to comment though, since you're using `init` in a non-traditional way
- Look for opportunities to reuse code you've already written
- Runtime analysis
    - the `.items` method of the hashtable class takes `b` time, since it iterates over all buckets
        - `.extend` method is to arrays like `+` is to strings. This takes `l2` time since we're appending each item in the second list to the first list
            - note that if you extend an array with an empty array, it's the same as doing nothing
        - `.append` happens in constant time
        - therefore takes `O(n)` time, where `n` is the number of items in the hashtable
    - `init` depends on `new_size`, which takes `2b` --> `O(b)` time and space
    - Final step is a `for` loop that runs the length of `current_entries` --> `n` --> `O(n)`, and we know `.set` is constant time
    - **`O(b) + O(n) + O(n)` --> `O(2n + b)` --> `O(n + b)` --> `O(b)` (with assumption of resize)**
