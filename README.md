# CS 1.3: Core Data Structures & Algorithms

### Course Description

This course explores the foundations of computer science including discrete mathematics, abstract data types, data structures, and algorithm analysis and design. Students will compare and contrast iterative and recursive algorithms to analyze design and performance tradeoffs. 

Students will implement and test data structures including lists, stacks, queues, sets, maps, and trees. Students will then apply these to real-world problems like phone call routing to understand their tradeoffs. Students will also write technical blog articles about these topics to deepen understanding, improve technical writing, and bolster their online presence as knowledgeable and proficient software engineers.


 
### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Implement, compare and contrast iterative and recursive algorithms.
1. Analyze best-case and worst-case time and space complexity of an algorithm.
1. Implement several abstract data types and data structures including linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, maps, sets, and binary search trees.
1. Implement tree traversal algorithms: depth-first and breadth-first ordering.
1. Write technical articles to deepen understanding and demonstrate mastery.


### Prerequisites

Students must pass the following course and demonstrate mastery of its competencies:
